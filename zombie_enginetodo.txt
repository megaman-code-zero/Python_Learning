#:Machine Gun Ranges
return ammo to bag  at the end of fight

  

Currently: its called when kill_range >= mag_count

if it takes more bullets then you have in magazine to kill zombie
    then check if you have more bullets 
    
    Does_not_ask it automatically re-loads weapon
        kill_completion
        if enough bullets in bag and some left in gun:
            then it loads till cap then shoots and subtracts again
            to finish kill
        elif some bullets + bullets in bag complete kill
            loads remaining bullets, clears bag of ammo
            completes kill and clears magazine
             
             
        no ammo in mag and no ammo in bag:
            'returns' you to change weapon

        if mag == 0 and bag > 0 
            re-load or switch
            if re_load 
                if bag > mag cap
                    load and then sub kill bullets
                    return
                #is this enough to kill zombie ?
                elif bag < mag_cap and bag > 0    
                    bag_count = 0
                    mag_count = bag
                    m_count - k_range

        
        
z_count = 4
b_count = 2
m_count = 0
k_diff = 4 - 0 = -4

I pass it through and this is what happens:

b_count = 0
        
m_count = 2
m_count = 4 - 2
m_count = -2

z killed..which is not true
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
if m_count > 0 and can complete kill          
z_kill = 3
I have 5 bullets
I kill zombie
I have 2 bullets left
k_diff = 3 - 2 = 1
m_load
m_count = 6
m_count = 6 - 1
zombie is now dead
I have 5 bullets left

z_kill = 3
m_count = 2
k_diff = 3 - 2 = 1
b_count = 1 bullet
m_load
b_count = 0
m_count = 1
m_count = 1 -1
m_count = 0
